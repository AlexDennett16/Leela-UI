# COMP2003-2023
## SPH GUI and Frontend

### Plan
Check Project plan! <br>
This project will create a GUI for use in creating a C++ .config file for use in the LEELA SPH software.  
We currently are deliberating on GUI software to finalise in, but are currently using .NET MAUI.  
We plan for Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to have This GUI, with sliders and changeable values. That will also create the .config file.  
Although we are not expecting to have full integration with our visualisation software (PARAVIEW) until the final showcase.  

### Current Progress
We have made no major changes to the Source code at this time, and will only be a final concern, if performance becomes a salient issue.   
The only changed element is the file pathing to discover the .config file, This will also need further refining.  
Trello board is setup, with current and future sprints detailed.  


### Installation
To run the application as intended:

1. Open comp2003_application.sln in Visual Studio and execute it in Release  
2. Run the program, then close it. Do not press "Start Simulation"  
3. Copy the "compiled leela" folder into /comp2003_application/bin/release/net7.0-windows10.0.19041.0/win10-x64  
4. Re-run the program, you can now press "Start Simulation"  
5. After running, the data files will be located in the executable folder /comp2003_application/bin/release/net7.0-windows10.0.19041.0/win10-x64
6. You can view the simulation using Para View
